            The Valbona Spring, situated proximate to the charming village of Rragam in the Shala region, serves as the origin of 
            the captivating Rragami Waterfall. Extending over an approximate distance of 50 kilometers, the Valbona River courses 
            through the valley, resurfacing at Dragobi village, where it carves the majestic Shoshani Canyon. Continuing its course, 
            it eventually converges with the Drin River, contributing to the sustenance of the expansive and tranquil Lake Fierza.
